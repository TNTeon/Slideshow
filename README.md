# Instructions
## Organization 
It is very important to have clear organization for the program to work correctly. 
Each "slide" should be composed of multiple images all in 1 folder. Ex. Folder named "Sponsors" should hold all your PNG images that your sponsorship slide contains. Each of these folders will gain its own window, displaying the PNGs in order.
Each folder for each slideshow should then be put into another folder. This folder can be anywhere and named anything. It is important that nothing else is inside this directory except for the folders holding your PNG images.
All monitors should be plugged into the PC before launching the program. Launching the program without any monitors will result in having to manually put each slides on each monitor. You should have an extra monitor attached to the pc for each slide folder you have.

## Launching
After running the program, you will be faced with a directory searcher. Select the directory containing all your slide folders. (The folder containing folders containing PNGs)
Each slide will open in a new window and be distributed to its own monitor. You shouldn't have any slides on your main monitor. The main monitor should be left with a small box with the Godot label. If you have more slides than monitors to hold them, any extras will be sent to your main display.
Each slide will be switching images every 1 second. Use this to make sure everything looks correct.

## Controls
- The small blank window on the main monitor contains the slide controllers. Select this window before using keyboard controls.
- Use Left/Right arrow keys to speed up or slow down cycling of images.
- Use Space or Enter to toggle between pausing and playing slides
- Use the Down arrow key to minimize all slides. Slides can now be moved manually to rearrange format.
- Use the Up arrow key to full-screen all slides
- Close the slide control window to close all slides.
